# Matrix
Count all possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix
=> The problem is to count all the possible paths from the top left to the bottom right of a M X N matrix with the constraints that 
from each cell you can either move only to the right or down
=> Examples: 

Input:  M = 2, N = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two paths
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1)
(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)

Input:  M = 2, N = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three paths
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2)
(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2)
(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2)
